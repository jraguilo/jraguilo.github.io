Pokedex is an Android application that is an encyclopedia of video game characters that utilizes text-to-speech in order to provide an enhanced user experience. 

Pokedex was developed by my team of four members for HackPoly, Cal Poly Pomona's 1st Hackathon. We were given 24 hours to develop any project, and we chose to use this time to experiement with our knowledge of Android.

Our application utilizes Android's Text-to-Speech libraries in order to provide the user with a speaking encyclopedia. Furthermore, our application utilized a cloud database, allowing us to easily scale our database for future entries.
